# Samples for TPM-based attestation using Microsoft Azure Attestation

These code samples show how attestation can be performed using the TPM. Additionally the sample takes advantage of the https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Attestation.Client

## List of Samples

### **Boot attestation (sample_boot_att.exe)**

This sample provides the code implementation to perform boot attestation, and retrieve an attestation token from Microsoft Azure Attestation.

### **TPM key attestation (sample_tpm_key_att.exe)**

This sample provides the code implementation to perform boot and TPM key attestation, and retrieve an attestation token from Microsoft Azure Attestation.
This sample creates a TPM key named "att_sample_key" which is attested by Microsoft Azure Attestation. The creation of a TPM key may take up to a few minutes depending on the TPM hardware.

## Sample Requirements

* The machine must have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM).

* The following environment variables must be set by the user:

    * **AZURE_TENANT_ID** - Tenant ID for the Azure account. Used for authenticated calls to the attestation service.
    * **AZURE_CLIENT_ID** - The client ID to authenticate the request. Used for authenticated calls to the attestation service.
    * **AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET** - The client secret. Used for authenticated calls to the attestation service.
    * **AZURE_MAA_URI** - Microsoft Azure Attestation provider's Attest URI (as shown in portal). Format is similar to "https://\<ProviderName\>.\<Region\>.attest.azure.net".

* An AIK named "att_sample_aik" must be available. Run the EnrollAik.ps1 script to create the key and retrieve an AIK certificate for it (notice that the command below allows the key to be accessed by all users on the machine):

```EnrollAik.ps1 att_sample_aik -AclIdentity BUILTIN\Users``` [^1]

[^1]: Some Windows built-in security group names may be localized. EnrollAik.ps1 also accepts a SID to grant permissions to a key: `EnrollAik.ps1 att_sample_aik -AclIdentitySid S-1-5-32-545`. More information about Windows security groups can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups).


## Running attestation samples

1. Set up an Azure Attestation provider with a **TPM** policy using the instructions at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/attestation/quickstart-portal.
2. Build the project (it can be built by opening the folder in Visual Studio 2022).
3. Make sure the sample requirements above are met.
4. Run one of the samples listed above.

## EnrollAik.ps1

This script automates the process of generating an Attestation Identity Key (AIK). It invokes the Cert Request utility which is provided as part of Windows and requests that a new key be generated in the TPM. It then registers this key with the certificate service and gets an AIK certificate that can then be used in the attestation flow. The script also provides an option to set the ACL on the key file (used by the Platform/TPM Key Storage Provider) such that it can be loaded from a user-mode process, as otherwise administrator privileges would be required for the client attestation application. 

Note: EnrollAik.ps1 won't be able to get an AIK certificate on a virtual machine because a virtual TPM does not have a trusted Endorsement Key certificate which is used by Azure Certificate Services to validate the TPM.
